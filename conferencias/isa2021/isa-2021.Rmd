# Background

* _**Reality Blended Hypothesis**_ `r Cite(bib, c("Evans2004"))`: Subjective Social Status (SSS) Formation as a result of objective position and social comparison processes with reference groups `r Cite(bib, c("festinger1954theory"))`. 

* Social Comparison processes are influenced by changes in social structure `r Cite(bib, c("Lindemann2014","ChenWilliams2018","chen_Discordance_2015"))`. However, the literature shows little evidence regarding how economic inequality affects SSS.

* Changes in social comparison processes affects SSS and this could motivate changes in distributive preferences `r Cite(bib, c("Condon2020"))`.

* Evidence on Perceptions about economic inequality shows that these experiences provide a picture of social comparison processes and biased images of society `r Cite(bib, c("Jasso1990"))`

# Data

1. **Individual data**: International Social Survey Programme 2009 -  Social Inequality IV

.center[![](https://www.gesis.org/typo3conf/ext/gesis_web_ext/Resources/Public/Styles/Frontend/img/ms_logos/gs_ms_issp_logo.svg)]

2. **Country data**: World Data Indicators (World Bank) and The Standardized World Income Inequality Database `r Cite(bib, c("Solt2020"))`  


> **Analytical sample:** 28559 Individuals nested in 39 contries.

# Dependent Variable

### Individual Level

**Objective Status:** Household Income Deciles (per cap)


**Perceived Salary Gap**: Indirect subjective inequality measurement


**Question:** _Please write in how much they ACTUALLY earn each (...)_

* How much do you think a **chairman of a large national corporation** earns?    
* How much do you think an **unskilled worker in a factory** earns? 


$$P=\ln\Bigg(\frac{\text{Chairman of corporation}}{\text{ unskilled worker}}\Bigg)$$
### Country level

1. **Country Wealth:** Gross Domestic Product (World Data Indicators)
2. **Objective Inequality:** Gini Index (World Data Indicators)


---
# Method

* Multilevel Regression with random effects `r Cite(bib, c("Hox2008"))`

  * $Y_{SSS} = \gamma_{00}+\gamma_{D10}+\gamma_{\text{ln(perceived)}}+\gamma_{\text{Gini}}+\mu_{0j}+\epsilon_{ij}$

  * $Y_{SSS} = \gamma_{00}+\gamma_{D10}+\gamma_{\text{ln(perceived)}}+\gamma_{D10}\times\gamma_{\text{ln(perceived)}}+\gamma_{\text{Gini}}+\mu_{0j}+\epsilon_{ij}$

  * $Y_{SSS} = \gamma_{00}+\gamma_{D10}+\gamma_{\text{ln(perceived)}}+\gamma_{D10}\times\gamma_{\text{Gini}}+\gamma_{\text{Gini}}+\mu_{0j}+\epsilon_{ij}$


* **Controls:** Gender, Age, Education, Job Status and GDP

# Conclusions

* Analysis support previous evidence concerning objective status and GDP. However, Objective inequality does not have a substantive effect on Subjective Social Status, neither direct nor as a moderator.

* Novel effect of perceived salary gap, also as a moderator of the association between objective and subjective social status.

* Subjective Inequality is more relevant than Objective Inequality concerning Subjective Status Formation. Evidence in favour of the **R&R Blended hypothesis**. 

* Could be interpreted (with caution) as a proxy of social comparison, under de assumption that objective status could lead to a biased image of society, and these perceptions contribute to changes in subjective social status.




---
# Future Research

* Evaluate how Objective Inequality moderates other objective status meassures (Education and Social Class)

* Other Model specifications: Group centering (GC) and other country level controls (% of Service Class vs Unskilled)

* Test these hypothesis using other datasets (LAPOP)
